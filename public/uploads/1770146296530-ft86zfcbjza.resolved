# Implementation Plan - New MVP Chat App (Figma 1:1)

This plan outlines the steps to build a premium, "conversion-focused" MVP chat application, perfectly matching the provided Figma design and including a "Chat with AI" bonus feature.

## Goal Description
Create a new Next.js application in `mvp-v2` (inside the existing `ChatApp` directory) that replicates the Figma design with high fidelity. The app will feature real-time messaging, Google Authentication, and an AI chat interface.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Project Location**: I will create the new project in a subfolder `mvp-v2` inside the current `ChatApp` directory to keep it organized and within workspace limits.
>
> **AI Feature**: The "Chat with AI" feature will be implemented with a **Mock AI** (simulated responses) initially to ensure the functional interface works without requiring immediate paid API keys. It can be easily connected to OpenAI/Gemini later.
>
> **Auth Library**: usage of `@react-oauth/google` is confirmed.

## Proposed Changes

### Setup & Infrastructure
#### [NEW] [mvp-v2/](file:///home/aaa/upwork/ChatApp/mvp-v2)
- Initialize new Next.js 14 project (App Router).
- Install dependencies: [prisma](file:///home/aaa/upwork/ChatApp/prisma/schema.prisma), `@prisma/client`, `pusher`, `pusher-js`, `@react-oauth/google`, `lucide-react`, `date-fns`.
- Setup Tailwind CSS with the specific **Mint/Teal** color palette extracted from Figma.

### Database (Prisma)
- Define [User](file:///home/aaa/upwork/ChatApp/components/UserList.tsx#12-382) model (id, email, name, picture, status).
- Define `Message` model (id, content, senderId, receiverId, createdAt).
- Define `ChatSession` model? (Or just infer from messages). *Plan: Explicit Session model for performance.*

### Authentication
- Implement Login Page adhering to "Conversion-Focused" design (Clean, simple, "Continue with Google").
- Configure `@react-oauth/google` provider.

### Core Features
- **User List**:
    - Real-time "Online/Offline" status using Pusher presence channels.
    - Search functionality.
- **Chat Interface (1:1)**:
    - 1:1 Figma match: 3-column layout (Sidebar, List, Chat).
    - Message Bubbles: Specific rounded styles, "Mint" for self, "White" for others.
    - Real-time message delivery.
- **Chat with AI**:
    - Detailed "AI" user in the list (pinned or separate section).
    - Mock backend to reply to user messages for demonstration.

### Documentation
- Create `README_NON_TECHNICAL.md`: A simple guide explaining "What this is", "How it works", and "Tools used" for non-tech stakeholders.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- `npm run lint`: Ensure no code style issues.
- `npm run build`: Verify successful production build.

### Manual Verification
1.  **Design Check**: Compare split-screen of App vs Figma Screenshots (captured previously) to ensure 1:1 visual match.
2.  **Auth Flow**: Login with Google, verify User creation in DB.
3.  **Real-Time**: Open two browser windows (Incognito vs Normal), chat between users, verify instant updates without refresh.
4.  **AI Chat**: Send message to "AI Bot", verify simulated response appears.
